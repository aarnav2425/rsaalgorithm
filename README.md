RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm for secure data transmission over the internet.
In RSA, a public key and a private key are generated by the recipient of the encrypted message. The public key can be shared with anyone who wants to send a message securely to the recipient, while the private key is kept secret by the recipient.
The encryption process involves converting the plaintext message into a series of numerical values, which are then encrypted using the recipient's public key. The resulting ciphertext can only be decrypted by the recipient using their private key.
here The two prime numbers, p and q, play a crucial role in the rsa encryption algorithm. They are used to generate a public and private key pair that is used for encrypting and decrypting messages.
In the rsa encryption algorithm, the public key is a pair of two integers (n, h), where n is the product of the two primes p and q, and h is a random integer between 1 and n-1 that is coprime with (p-1) * (q-1).
The private key is a pair of two integers (p, q), which are the two primes used to generate the public key. The private key is kept secret and is used for decrypting the encrypted message.
